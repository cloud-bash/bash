# bash

#Should create 25 directories self-named and numbered consecutively
#filling in any missing numbers below the current highest directory index when present.

#If no directories, create <username><01-25>
#If directories exist, for example <username>01-25 already exist because we just created the first 25
#  then create <username><26-50>
#  if <username>19-21 are missing
#    create <username><19-21> and the rest of the 22 requested directories
